# Development

## Structure

The project is structured as a monorepo with the following folders:

- `src`: Contains Next.js frontend source code.
- `src-tauri`: Contains Tauri specific configuration, handlers, and entry point for desktop application.
- `storyforge`: Backend containing entry point for FastAPI server.
- `tests`: Unit tests and integration tests for FastAPI server.

## Pre-requisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

1. [Bun](https://bun.sh): Performant JavaScript runtime, bundler and dependency manager used for the frontend.
2. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org): Used for building cross-platform desktop application with Tauri. Install it via [`rustup`](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
3. [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): Packaging and dependency manager for Python, used for the FastAPI backend.

## Building the project

1. Clone the repository from GitHub

```shell
git clone https://github.com/grittypuffy/storyforge/
```

2. Install the needed dependencies

```shell
cd storyforge

poetry install # For installation of dependencies related to Python backend

bun install # Installs dependencies for frontend

cd src-tauri

cargo update # Updates the dependencies
```

3. Run the development build using `cargo tauri dev`

## Contributing

Fork the project, create a new branch and add your dependencies needed for the project, or make changes to the source file as needed.

1. Add dependencies for the build during development by the following commands:

- For Tauri: `cargo add <dependency-crate-name>`
- For Next.js frontend: `bun add <npm-dependency-name>`
- For Python backend: `poetry add <pypi-dependency-name>`. Ensure that you have the virtual environment activated for this to work. You can use `poetry shell` for activating it.

### **Note:**

SSR (Server-side Rendering) isn't supported in Tauri, so we use SSG (Static-Site Generation). [Check this blog post for more information regarding this](https://vercel.com/blog/nextjs-server-side-rendering-vs-static-generation)
